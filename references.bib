	abstract = {Thematic maps show spatial distributions. The theme refers to the phenomena that is shown, which is often demographical, social, cultural, or economic. The best known thematic map type is the choropleth, in which regions are colored according to the distribution of a data variable. The R package tmap offers a coherent plotting system for thematic maps that is based on the layered grammar of graphics. Thematic maps are created by stacking layers, where per layer, data can be mapped to one or more aesthetics. It is also possible to generate small multiples. Thematic maps can be further embellished by configuring the map layout and by adding map attributes, such as a scale bar and a compass. Besides plotting thematic maps on the graphics device, they can also be made interactive as an HTML widget. In addition, the R package tmaptools contains several convenient functions for reading and processing spatial data.},

@incollection{Stock:2016aa,
	abstract = {Geospatial data is data about objects, events, or phenomena that have a location on the surface of the earth, including location information (usually coordinates on the earth), attribute information (the characteristics of the object, event, or phenomena concerned), and often also temporal information (the time or life span at which the location and attributes exist). In this chapter, we discuss the ways in which geospatial reasoning has been applied to open data. We define geospatial reasoning as both reasoning about the location of objects on the earth (e.g., relating to inference of spatial relationships) and reasoning about geospatial data (e.g., relating to the attributes of data that is geospatial in nature). We then present two case studies to illustrate the use of geospatial reasoning with open data: (1) the use of fuzzy reasoning for map buffering and (2) methods for automatically learning nonclassical ontologies from geospatial data (data driven ontologies).},
